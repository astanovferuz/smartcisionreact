        decProblem: "I want to buy a new car, but I am on budget. My old car isn't bad but I just want this new car so much. In fact, I need this money for my 2nd year in college but it's like a year away from now and I think I will be able to earn it back in a year's time. I am not sure if it's right tho. I really really want a new car.",

But I do need to work on Mondays and I feel super tired if I don't get good sleep before my long shift. I feel bad to say no to my friends, since I am afraid they will stop inviting me, but at the same time I don't want to compromise my employment. What should I do?",

        decProblem: "I live in a two bedroom apartment and I never really keep anything in the other bedroom and don't even walk in there. So I thought it'd be a good ideat to rent that room out to someone, so I can make some money on the side. There are many colleges around my place and some students always look for accommodation in this area. I am still thinking though whether or not it's a good idea. I kinda like living alone too",

        decProblem: "My friend has been asking me to lend him some money. Not a lot. Something like 200 bucks. But I am worried about getting it back. I know he doesn't work and is not even looking for job, so how would he be able to return the money? I don't mind helping out a friend, but I also want him to keep his end of the deal since I don't like to chase my own money. I am not sure if it's right or wrong to lend him money.",
